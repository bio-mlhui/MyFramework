## Task-Agnostic Coding Framework Overview

This is my task-agnostic coding framework. It currently supports various functionalities including:

- Referring Video/Image Segmentation (RIS)
- Image/Video Instance/Object Segmentation

### Ongoing Developments

I am now working on incorporating advanced synthesis capabilities into the framework:

- **Novel-View Synthesis (Images to 3D)**
- **Dynamic Novel-View Synthesis (Video to 4D)**

### Implementation Details

This codebase includes implementations of the following academic submissions:

1. [ECCV2024 submission](./readme/EventRR.pdf)  [CVPR2024 reviews](./readme/screencapture-openreview-net-forum-2024-04-25-11_37_54.png) 
    - **Title:** "EventRR: Event Referential Reasoning for Referring Video Object Segmentation"
    - **Authors:** Huihui Xu, [Qiang Nie], Lei Zhu
    

2. [MICCAI2024 submission](./readme/LGRNet.pdf)
    - **Title:** "LGRNet: Local-Global Reciprocal Network for Uterine Fibroid Segmentation in Ultrasound Videos"
